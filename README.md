# BOT
BOT (Block Oriented Template) is a minimal programming language that I wrote for fun.
# Example code
```
CALL
  GBL "SYSTEM.PRINT"
  ARR "Hello World!"
```
To compile run ``lua bc.lua -i include/system.bot -i hello.bot -c hello.lua``
# Compiling the compiler
BOT is fully self-hosting and you can recompile the compiler by running the ``make`` command in the source folder.
