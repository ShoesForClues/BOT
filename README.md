# BOT
BOT (Block Operation Tree) is a minimal dynamically-typed programming language that compiles to Lua and other languages.
# Hello World
```
CALL
	GBL "SYSTEM.PRINT" ;Make sure to include the system library
	ARR "Hello World!"
```
You can find more examples under [examples](examples).
# Compiling the compiler
BOT is fully self-hosting and you can recompile the compiler by running the ``make`` command in the source folder. (Make sure you have Lua 5.1+ installed first)
